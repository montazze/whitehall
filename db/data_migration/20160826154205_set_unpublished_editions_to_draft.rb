#all of these editions are DetailedGuides that have been Unpublished with a
#redirect (consolidated) but then either submitted again or submitted then
#rejected (all months ago). This is causing them to now 404 instead of redirecting
#on the live site and not be correctly republished during migration.
#Setting them to `draft` makes them behave correctly when they are republished
#
#There isn't a valid transition from submitted back to draft without publishing
#so this 'seems' like the best approach
